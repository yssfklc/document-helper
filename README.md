# Biography Question Answering Project

## Overview

This project is developed to answer biography questions from documents using a combination of technologies including Streamlit, Python, Langchain, Pinecone, and OpenAI. The project aims to provide a convenient solution for extracting relevant information from biographical documents through a user-friendly interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Streamlit**: Used for building interactive web applications with Python.
- **Python**: Programming language used for the backend logic and data processing.
- **Langchain**: Utilized for natural language processing tasks, especially in understanding biographical text.
- **Pinecone**: Employs vector similarity search for efficient document retrieval.
- **OpenAI**: Provides advanced natural language processing capabilities for understanding and generating text.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to enable users to input biography questions and receive accurate answers derived from biographical documents. It streamlines the process of extracting relevant information from extensive text sources, thereby saving time and effort for researchers, students, and enthusiasts interested in biographical studies.

## Project Management

This project follows the RAG (Red, Amber, Green) project management system to track progress and ensure timely completion of tasks. The system allows for effective monitoring of project status and facilitates communication among team members regarding any issues or challenges encountered during development.
